# QuickTutor lab:101 team:cs4life
# This app presents a way for anyone that creates a quickTutor profile to become both a Tutor or Tutee. The idea is that if you ask a simple question and someone else on the app is nearby, they can accept your question, meet up with you, and help you for a quick tutor session. 
# Note: when creating a profile, it asks for a credit card number. Our database does NOT require or save this information! This was put in place to exemplify where payment would be implemented IF it was to incorporate a payment API.
